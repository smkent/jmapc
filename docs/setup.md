# One time setup

These steps only need to be completed once after the project is first created.

## GitHub repository

[Settings → General][repo-settings]:

- [x] Allow merge commits
- [ ] Allow squash merging
- [ ] Allow rebase merging
- [x] Automatically delete head branches

[Settings → Branches][repo-settings-branches] → Add branch protection rule
for the Default branch (`main`):

- [x] Restrict deletions
- [x] Require a pull request before merging
- [x] Block force pushes

## Renovate

Ensure the [Renovate app][renovate] is installed on your account, then
enable it for `smkent/jmapc`.

## PyPI publishing

This project uses [trusted publishing][pypi-trusted-publishing] so no API tokens
need to be stored as secrets.

1. On PyPI, add a (pending) trusted publisher in your
   [Trusted Publisher Management][pypi-publishing-settings] settings:
     - Publisher: GitHub Actions
     - Owner: `smkent`
     - Repository: `jmapc`
     - Workflow: `release.yaml`
     - Environment: `pypi`
2. Create the `pypi` environment in the GitHub repository:
   [Settings → Environments][repo-settings-envs] → New environment → `pypi`
3. Publish a release by pushing a tag:
   ```sh
   git tag v0.1.0  # or your desired first version number
   git push --tags
   ```
